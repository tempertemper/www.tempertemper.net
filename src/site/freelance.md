Alongside my consultancy work, I occasionally take on freelance and contract roles; mainly in the public sector, but I'm open to private sector projects too.

That might mean embedding within a design, frontend, or multi-disciplinary team; taking on an interim position, covering a short-term gap, or picking up work a team doesn't have time for. I'm comfortable joining existing teams and fitting into established ways of working.

I work remotely by default, but I'm open to hybrid arrangements if a contract requires regular on-site time. I'm set up to work through my limited company or an umbrella company, depending on the project and IR35 status.

Iâ€™ve worked with organisations like HMRC, and understand the pace, structure, and expectations of government contracts. If you need extra hands on a project, short-term support in **accessibility** or **interaction design**, feel free to [get in touch](/contact).
