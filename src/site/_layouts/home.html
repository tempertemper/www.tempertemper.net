    <h2 id="my-favourite-subjects">Subjects</h2>
    <p>There are a few topics that really interest me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/category/accessibility">Accessibility</a> is about designing and building web interfaces that can be used by everyone, something I feel very strongly about</li>
        <li><a href="/category/design">Designing</a> smart, usable interfaces, journeys and interactions is what I do best, and I enjoy analysing othersâ€™ great design</li>
        <li><a href="/category/development">Frontend development</a> is a huge passion of mine; HTML and CSS in particular, but anything from Git to npm</li>
    </ul>
     <p>Have a look at the <a href="/categories">full list of subjects</a> I write about.</p>
