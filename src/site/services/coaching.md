Coaching and mentoring give people the space and support to grow their accessibility skills over time. Unlike one-off [training sessions or workshops](/services/training), mentoring is about ongoing guidance: answering questions, reviewing real work, and helping people build confidence as they apply accessibility in their day-to-day.

I work with individuals or small groups, making sessions practical and relevant to their roles, whether they’re designers, developers, testers, product managers, or leaders responsible for accessibility across teams.


## Format

Sessions can be arranged as regular one-to-ones, drop-in office hours, or small-group clinics. Sessions are usually carried out remotely, but can be done in person if that's what works best for you. My style is informal and supportive, with the focus on making progress in real projects rather than theory.


## Typical duration

This approach works best as a series of short sessions over a few weeks or months, so there’s time to apply learning in between. A common pattern is a block of four to six sessions, but this can be extended or adjusted to fit your needs.


## How it helps

Coaching and mentoring:

- provide ongoing support to reinforce skills learned in [training and workshops](/services/training)
- help individuals and small groups tackle accessibility challenges in their own projects
- build lasting confidence so accessibility becomes part of everyday practice

This service can [stand on its own](/approaches/projects), or be part of a wider engagement. If you’re looking for broader support shaping policy, process, or culture, take a look at [my consultancy approach](/approaches/consultancy).
