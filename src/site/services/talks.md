intro: Talks on accessibility that raise awareness, share real-world insight, and inspire teams to design and build more inclusively.

I give talks that raise awareness of accessibility and inspire people to think differently about how they design and build digital products. These might be at conferences, company events, or in-house sessions such as [Global Accessibility Awareness Day](https://accessibility.day).

Talks work well when you want to spark interest, start a conversation, or motivate people who are new to accessibility. They are less about hands-on skills and more about showing why accessibility matters and what it looks like in practice. Talks can also play a part in [building culture and community](/services/culture), for example as part of awareness days or ongoing learning groups.

## Format

Talks can be short, around 20 to 30 minutes, or run for up to an hour with time for questions and discussion. They can be delivered remotely or in person, depending on what works best for your audience.


## Topics

I cover a wide range of themes, from the basics of universal design to the legal and commercial drivers behind accessibility. Talks draw on my experience leading accessibility programmes, my work advising teams on processes, and my background in hands-on design and development.

A recent example is my talk [Creating a Culture of Accessibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMFoX0gzLfA) at Natter in Manchester.

Talks are often a first step. They build momentum and can lead to [training, workshops](/services/training), or consultancy when teams want to go deeper.
