Accessibility reviews are a lighter alternative to a [full audit](/services/audits). They are fast, focused, and designed to give teams immediate clarity without a large engagement. They concentrate on a specific journey, components, or features so you get quick feedback without the depth or formality of an audit.

Teams usually use reviews when they want:

- a way to kickstart your accessibility journey
- to check progress at key stages in a project
- fast assurance on some work
- to check accessibility early in the delivery process

Reviews work equally well on live products or design files in tools like Figma or Sketch.

## What you get

- Clear findings focused on real user tasks
- Screenshots and examples where useful
- Practical fixes informed by accessibility best practice
- Prioritised actions for quick wins
- Optional paired walkthrough on a call

## Approach

Reviews are lightweight by design. You share links, screenshots, or design files and I review them asynchronously. Findings are delivered in a concise, accessible report that highlights the biggest risks and opportunities.

Reviews do not have to be measured against the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag/) unless you need that level of formality. Design-only reviews tend to focus on early usability, potential blockers, and clarity for assistive technology users.

Where it is useful, we can explore the results together in a short call to make sure your teams understand what to prioritise and why.


## How this fits into wider work

Reviews often act as the starting point for a [standalone project](/approaches/projects) at the beginning of our engagement; they are also a useful way to measure milestones as part of a [longer consultancy engagement](/approaches/consultancy). They are a low-commitment way to understand where you stand and give your teams momentum.


## Timescales

A review can be produced in around one week, but can be produced even quicker if the scope is tightened.


## Follow-up

Follow-up is usually a short check-in to confirm progress, validate fixes, and ensure the changes have had the intended effect. This keeps reviews fast and focused while still giving your teams support where they need it.

I can also provide ongoing [coaching and mentoring](/services/coaching) to help teams build skills as they work through fixes.

Reviews give you fast, actionable insight. They sit neatly alongside audits and consultancy, helping teams make meaningful improvements early in the process.
