A well-governed design system helps teams build consistent, accessible products at scale. I help organisations make sure their design systems support, rather than hinder, accessibility.

Accessibility in design systems isn't just about compliant components. It's about clear guidance, confident teams, and consistent decisions that make inclusion part of every product by default. That can mean:

- [Reviewing components and patterns](/services/audits) for accessibility issues
- Writing or improving accessibility guidance and documentation for designers, developers, and other contributors, including practical checklists and examples
- Supporting [governance](/services/strategy), including ownership and decision-making around accessibility standards
- Delivering [training](/services/training) for design system contributors and maintainers
- Helping design system teams work more closely with product teams
- Embedding accessibility checks into contribution and review processes

Teams often work to different accessibility baselines depending on context and maturity. I can help define appropriate targets, whether aligning to [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), or [internal standards](/blog/accessibility-doesnt-stop-at-wcag-compliance), and ensure those expectations are clearly reflected in your policy and documentation.

Whether your system is mature or just getting started, I can help your team build accessibility into its foundations.
