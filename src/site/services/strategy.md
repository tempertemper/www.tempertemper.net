intro: Strategic support to shape the policies, programmes, and processes needed for long term, sustainable accessibility across your organisation.

Sometimes organisations need more than [audits](/services/audits) or [training](/services/training); they need clear direction. Without a strategy, accessibility work can end up patchy, dependent on individuals, and hard to sustain. A well-defined approach gives your organisation structure, accountability, and a way to measure progress.

I work with leadership teams, product managers, and product owners to shape the frameworks that make accessibility stick. This isn't about fixing a single product, it's about creating the conditions for accessibility to succeed across your organisation, often alongside [building culture and community](/services/culture) and [coaching](/services/coaching).

Typical strategy and guidance work includes:

- Drafting accessibility policies and governance structures
- Aligning accessibility with business goals and customer needs
- Running maturity assessments to understand your current position, using frameworks such as the [Digital Accessibility Maturity Model (DAMM)](https://www.levelaccess.com/blog/the-digital-accessibility-maturity-model-introduction-to-damm/)
- Designing accessibility programmes and roadmaps that set priorities and plan activity over time
- Advising on roles, responsibilities, and ownership across teams
- Embedding accessibility into [design systems](/services/design-systems), delivery processes, and procurement
- Defining organisational metrics, including KPIs and OKRs, to measure progress and create accountability
- Establishing product-level measurement, such as [audits](/services/audits) and spot-checks, with clear reporting and MI to track accessibility in practice


## Delivery

For some organisations, this kind of work is a [standalone project](/approaches/projects) with a defined scope, such as drafting a policy or running a maturity assessment. For others, it is part of a [longer consultancy engagement](/approaches/consultancy) where we build capability and embed accessibility step by step.

The outcome is more than a document. You'll have a clear strategy, a roadmap that people understand, and processes that ensure accessibility survives staff changes and scales as your organisation grows. It also reduces legal and reputational risk, creates commercial opportunity by reaching more customers, and shows commitment to customers, regulators, and your own teams.

This approach is explored further in my [Creating a culture of accessibility case study](/portfolio/creating-a-culture-of-accessibility).
