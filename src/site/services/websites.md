I work primarily as an [accessibility consultant](/approaches/consultancy), but I enjoy the occasional website project.


## Approach

I design and build fast, accessible websites that look great and work well across all browsers and devices. [Here's an example](/portfolio/making-a-website-accessible) from my long-standing client, Gusto Research.

Every site is built from scratch using clean, semantic HTML, modern CSS, and just enough JavaScript to do the job. I typically use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), which keeps sites lightweight, quick to load, and easy to maintain.

I can also work with existing websites, for example, to improve accessibility, refresh design, or restructure content, when a full rebuild isn't the right step.

My background in frontend development and user experience design means I care about structure, usability, and performance, with accessibility baked in from the start. I take a consultative approach and will sometimes challenge assumptions, always constructively and with your goals in mind.


## Content

You'll provide the content, and I'll make sure it's structured and presented clearly. For ongoing updates, I often use [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org) with Eleventy, but I won't make everything editable by default. Instead, I'll focus on the parts you'll update most, keeping things simple and cost-effective. Less frequent updates can be handled ad hoc or as part of a retainer.


## Delivery

We'll agree a realistic schedule up front, based on scope and your availability for feedback. Timelines vary depending on the project. A full website build might take several weeks, while improving an existing site's accessibility can often be quicker and more focused.

When the project's complete, you'll get everything you need to take the site forward: code, assets, and any relevant documentation. You own the site outright. I can provide hosting (typically via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)) and ongoing maintenance, usually on retainer, to keep things running smoothly.

I design accessible websites that are fast, easy to use, and built to last. I value long-term, collaborative relationships, and I'll be there to support you as your site evolves.
