Accessibility lasts when it becomes part of an organisation's culture. I help you create the structures, networks, and shared practices that make accessibility a natural part of everyday work.

Typical culture and community work includes:

- Setting up, [training](/services/training), [coaching](/services/coaching) and supporting accessibility champions within product teams, such as designers, developers, and QAs
- Running accessibility learning groups, drop-in sessions, and shared spaces in Slack or Teams to share knowledge and solve problems together
- Planning and delivering events such as [Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)](/portfolio/scaling-accessibility-awareness-at-sage-five-years-of-gaad), often including [talks](/services/talks) to build momentum and visibility
- Creating resources, playbooks, or intranet hubs that help teams find the guidance they need, when they need it
- Advising on recognition and incentives that reward accessibility contributions and encourage long-term engagement

My style is friendly and informal, which helps these kinds of groups and initiatives feel approachable and encourages people to take part.

## Delivery

Culture change takes time. Some organisations start with a [standalone project](/approaches/projects), such as running a GAAD event or piloting a champions network. Others take a [longer consultancy approach](/approaches/consultancy), building community step by step until accessibility is embedded in everyday practice, often alongside broader [strategy and guidance](/services/strategy).

A strong culture makes accessibility sustainable. It creates a sense of shared ownership, spreads knowledge through learning groups and shared spaces, and ensures that accessibility doesn't just depend on a few specialists.

This kind of work is explored in my [Creating a culture of accessibility case study](https://www.tempertemper.net/portfolio/creating-a-culture-of-accessibility).
