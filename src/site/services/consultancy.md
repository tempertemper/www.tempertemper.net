intro: Strategic, hands-on support to embed accessibility into your teams, products, and processes; and make it a lasting part of how you work.
---

I support organisations of all sizes, from early-stage startups to global companies, with practical, strategic guidance on building accessibility into their work.

## What I offer

I tailor my support to each teamâ€™s needs, drawing on experience from a FTSE 100 company with nearly 11,000 employees across 23 countries. That might include:

- <b>Strategy and programme design</b>, embedding accessibility at scale, from governance to workflows and culture
- <b>Design system integration</b>, baking accessibility into your components, patterns, and guidance
- <b>Audits and advice</b>, providing manual reviews of websites, apps, and design systems, with coaching to help teams find solutions that fit technical constraints, business goals, and user needs
- <b>Workshops and capability-building</b>, with hands-on training for designers, developers, researchers, QA testers, and product managers


## Typical engagement

The length of an engagement depends on the size and complexity of your organisation. A typical partnership begins with <b>discovery and audit</b>, where I learn how your business operates (the people, teams, culture, and workflows) and audit key products and identify barriers to accessibility. From there, I provide support across:

- <b>Awareness and culture</b>, establishing community spaces and regular touch points, and giving presentations to build awareness
- <b>Training and upskilling</b>, with hands-on coaching and workshops tailored to different roles
- <b>Process and policy integration</b>, embedding accessibility into team workflows, and guiding teams to the tools and practices that will help
- <b>Documentation and guidance</b>, creating clear, practical resources in your design system, intranet, or team wikis to help teams work accessibly
- <b>Compliance and metrics</b>, establishing KPIs and tracking progress over time


## How I work

I'm remote-first and flexible, but I'm happy to travel occasionally if there's value in being in the room with others. I work closely with teams to make accessibility part of their everyday work; helping them learn, collaborate, and keep improving, not just handing over a list of fixes. My goal is to build confidence and capability, not dependency.


## Who I work with

I typically partner with:

- Product organisations looking to improve or scale their accessibility practices
- Startups or new products within a wider ecosystem that want to get accessibility right from the start
- Organisations facing regulatory requirements or internal accessibility goals
- Design system and platform teams
