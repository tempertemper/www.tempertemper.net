An accessibility audit gives you a detailed view of where your product stands against recognised accessibility standards such as the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag/). You get a clear, practical report with:

- An executive summary for leadership
- Clear findings, including screenshots and code examples where relevant
- Steps to replicate
- Who each issue affects
- Severity levels to help prioritise fixes

Audits are a useful way to understand where you stand, to validate the work your team has already done, or to demonstrate that you meet an agreed accessibility benchmark.


## Approach

An accessibility audit involves structured manual testing using assistive technologies such as screen readers and speech recognition software. The aim is to give your teams clarity on what needs attention and how to make improvements.

For earlier-stage work or quick feedback on a specific feature, [accessibility reviews](/services/reviews) offer a lighter way to get insight before deciding whether an in-depth audit is needed.


### How I work

1. Define the scope together so the audit reflects real user journeys
2. Carry out detailed testing on each page and component in those journeys
3. Provide clear findings and practical recommendations in context of your research, technical constraints, and business goals
4. Walk through the results together in a paired review so your teams understand the issues and next steps
5. Offer follow-on support where useful; this can include coaching, hands-on remediation help, or retesting work to validate fixes

This approach supports both [one-off audits](/approaches/projects) and [longer engagements](/approaches/consultancy) where teams want ongoing guidance as part of their accessibility work.


## Audit scope

Audits are not always exhaustive, particularly for large or complex products. We will work together to define a set of user journeys that give the clearest real-world picture. These journeys:

- reflect the tasks your users complete most often
- include as many key components and states as possible

Every stage of each journey is tested in detail. This approach works across websites, complex web applications, and mobile apps.


## Timescales and delivery

A full audit typically takes four to six weeks, depending on the size and complexity of your product. Smaller audits are quicker.

Audit reports are delivered as fully accessible HTML documents. These are usually hosted on a password protected private domain but can also be provided as a .zip file for local viewing.


## Follow-up

A follow-up meeting is arranged around a week after delivery so your teams have time to digest the findings. This is your chance to ask questions, explore decisions, and plan next steps.

Optional ongoing support is available; this can include [coaching](/services/coaching), remediation assistance, or retesting to validate fixes and identify any issues introduced since the initial audit.

Accessibility audits give your teams a clear understanding of where things stand and a practical path forward. Whether the audit is a standalone deliverable or the start of a longer collaboration, the outcome is actionable insight that helps your teams make meaningful improvements.
