An audit gives you a detailed view of where your product stands against recognised accessibility standards such as the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag/). You'll get a report with clear findings and guidance on how to prioritise fixes.

Reports can include practical recommendations your teams can use to make the fixes. For many organisations, this takes the form of a [standalone project](/approaches/projects) with a clear scope and timescale. In a [longer consultancy engagement](/approaches/consultancy), the focus is different; instead of delivering a report, I help teams fix issues and build capability through [training and workshops](/services/training), while embedding accessibility into delivery, taking technical constraints, user testing, and business needs into account.


## Audit scope

Audits are typically not exhaustive; instead, I work with you to define a set of user journeys that give the clearest picture of accessibility in practice. These journeys:

- reflect the most common tasks your users complete
- include as many of the key components as possible

Each stage of each journey is tested in detail, covering every element on the page and, where relevant, different states of those elements. This approach works whether your product is a website, a complex web application, or a mobile app.


## Timescales

A full audit typically takes four to six weeks, depending on the size and complexity of your product. Smaller audits and lighter-touch reviews can be quicker.


## Reviews

Reviews are a lighter alternative to a full audit. They focus on a specific journey, components, or new features, giving you quick feedback without the depth of a full audit. A review typically takes one to two weeks and is useful when you need fast assurance or want to check accessibility early in the delivery process.


## Follow-up

Accessibility is not just about identifying issues but making sure they get fixed. After an audit or review, I follow up to confirm progress, validate fixes, and ensure the changes have had the intended effect. I take an approachable, collaborative style into these follow-ups, so teams feel supported rather than policed.

I can also provide ongoing [coaching and mentoring](/services/coaching) to help teams build skills as they work through fixes.

Audits and reviews give you a clear picture of where things stand and a practical path forward. Whether itâ€™s a comprehensive audit or a lighter review, the outcome is the same; actionable insight that helps your teams make meaningful improvements.
