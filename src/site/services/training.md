Training and workshops help your teams build the skills and confidence they need to make digital products more accessible. Sessions are practical, collaborative, and made specifically for your organisation.


## Training

Training sessions give your teams a clear grounding in accessibility. They can cover broad fundamentals or focus on specific areas such as design, development, or testing. Sessions are structured and practical, usually mixing short [presentations](/services/talks) with discussion and exercises. Teams get the chance to learn, ask questions, and explore how accessibility applies to their role.


## Workshops

Workshops are more interactive than training. They focus on applying accessibility principles to real projects and challenges, so people leave with practical experience as well as knowledge. A workshop might involve reviewing a live product, tackling a specific design challenge, or working through a user journey together. They can be run for a single discipline or as a cross-functional group, building a shared understanding of accessibility.


## Format

Sessions can be as short as an hour or run as a half-day or full-day. Workshops often need more time, sometimes a half or full day. For bigger topics or broader groups, training can be delivered as a series of linked sessions, each focused on a different area or role.

All sessions can be delivered remotely or in person, depending on what works best for your teams.


## Mentoring and coaching

These sessions are a strong starting point, but lasting change comes with practice. I offer mentoring and coaching to support individuals and teams as they put accessibility into action, building confidence and capability over time.

Training and workshops give your teams the knowledge, skills, and confidence to make accessibility part of everyday practice. With mentoring and coaching to reinforce learning, accessibility becomes something your teams can carry forward long after the sessions are over, often sparking broader initiatives like [building culture and community](/services/culture) through champions networks and shared spaces.
