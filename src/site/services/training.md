Training and workshops help your teams build the skills and confidence they need to make digital products more accessible. Sessions are practical, collaborative, and made specifically for your organisation.


## Training

Training sessions give your teams a clear grounding in accessibility. They can cover broad fundamentals or focus on specific areas such as design, development, or testing. Sessions are structured and practical, usually mixing short [presentations](/services/talks) with discussion and exercises. Teams get the chance to learn, ask questions, and explore how accessibility applies to their role.


## Workshops

Workshops are more interactive than training. They focus on applying accessibility principles to real projects and challenges, so people leave with practical experience as well as knowledge. A workshop might involve reviewing a live product, tackling a specific design challenge, or working through a user journey together. They can be run for a single discipline or as a cross-functional group, building a shared understanding of accessibility.


## Format

Sessions can be as short as an hour or run as a half-day or full-day. Workshops often need more time, sometimes a half or full day. For bigger topics or broader groups, training can be delivered as a series of linked sessions, each focused on a different area or role.

All sessions can be delivered remotely or in person, depending on what works best for your teams; my style is informal and friendly, making them approachable and engaging for groups of any size.

With [coaching and mentoring](/services/coaching) for individuals or small groups, teams can keep building confidence as they apply what theyâ€™ve learned.
