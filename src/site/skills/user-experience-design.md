Call it user experience design, UX design, usability design, user-centred design or UCD, it amounts to the same thing. And, like [frontend development](/skills/frontend-development), user experience design is too broad to talk about without breaking it down further.

For me, it starts with service design; that high-level vision of how a service should fit together and function. Understanding the constraints of various parts of the service, designing the rest around that, influencing stakeholders; service design looks at the full start to finish (or end-to-end) user journeys. I've worked on everything from sign-up processes and documentation/guidance, to email notifications and fixing pain points with the human beings that sit behind a digital product/service.

Interaction design is where it gets *really* interesting for me; controlling the way a user interacts with a website, product or service. I love digging into the routes a user might take on their journey, as well as the fine details of an interface that affect how they interact with it. The designs I produce are carefully thought through, inclusive, accessible, user-centred and tested with real users. Some deliverables I regularly produce:

- User journey diagrams, user flows and sitemaps
- Wireframes
- More detailed mock-ups and basic prototypes in software like Sketch and Figma
- Code-based prototypes (built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript)

Although not my specialism, I have a solid grasp of content design and strategy; especially in areas such as page structure and prioritisation, and information architecture. The language used in an interface can greatly affect how the user progresses through a service, as well as how they interact with individual elements on a page, and this is fascinating to me.

User research is often counted as part of user experience design, and I've done my fair share, but I prefer to work with the information gleaned *by* a user researcher (as well as customer satisfaction scores, analytics and other performance metrics) to inform, iterate and validate my designs.
