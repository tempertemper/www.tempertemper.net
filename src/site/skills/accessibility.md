title: Accessibility
intro: Expertise in designing and building accessible products, with strengths in strategy, audits, training, and hands-on support.

My background in [user experience design](/skills/user-experience-design) and [frontend development](/skills/frontend-development) naturally led me to accessibility.

When designing and building a digital product, it must work for everyone, and that includes disabled people. Accessibility ensures that product teams consider a wide range of abilities and perspectives:

- Designers, in how they handle visuals, content, components, patterns, and interaction flows
- Developers, to make sure the HTML (and ARIA), CSS, and JavaScript work seamlessly with assistive technologies like keyboard navigation and screen readers
- User researchers, who may need support when testing with disabled users
- QA testers, to go beyond automated tools like axe DevTools and include manual testing with assistive tech
- Product owners to support in the prioritisation of accessibility fixes
- Product managers, to help shape accessible project priorities

But my work doesn't stop at the hands-on product level. I also:

- Run training sessions and workshops tailored to different disciplines
- Give talks on accessibility, from broad overviews to deep-dives
- Host drop-in 'surgery' sessions for questions, blockers, and advice
- Audit products for accessibility issues and categorise them clearly for teams to action
- Track progress on audit findings
- Write design system documentation and accessibility guidance
- Help shape accessibility strategy across products and organisations
