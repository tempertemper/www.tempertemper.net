title: Accessibility
intro: Expertise in designing and building accessible products, with strengths in strategy, audits, training, and hands-on support.

My background in [user experience design](/skills/user-experience-design) and [frontend development](/skills/frontend-development) naturally led me to accessibility.

When designing and building a digital product, it must work for everyone, and that includes disabled people. Accessibility ensures that product teams consider a wide range of abilities and perspectives:

- Designers, in how they handle visuals, content, components, patterns, and interaction flows
- Developers, to make sure the HTML (and ARIA), CSS, and JavaScript work seamlessly with assistive technologies like keyboard navigation and screen readers
- User researchers, who may need support when testing with disabled users
- QA testers, to go beyond automated tools like axe DevTools and include manual testing with assistive tech
- Product owners to support in the prioritisation of accessibility fixes
- Product managers, to help shape accessible project priorities

Beyond hands-on product work, I also:

- Run [training sessions and workshops](/services/training) tailored to different disciplines
- Give [talks on accessibility](/services/talks), from broad overviews to deep-dives
- Host drop-in 'surgery' sessions for questions, blockers, and advice
- [Audit products for accessibility issues](/services/audits), categorising findings clearly for teams to action, and provide ongoing monitoring
- Write [design system documentation](/services/design-systems) and accessibility guidance
- Help shape [accessibility strategy](/services/strategy) across products and organisations

If you're looking for help embedding accessibility in your team or product, take a look at [my consultancy services](/approaches/consultancy).
