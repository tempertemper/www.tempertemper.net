My skills in frontend development, user experience design, and accessibility overlap and support each other. I help teams build inclusive, user-friendly digital products by combining solid implementation with considered design and a deep understanding of accessibility from the outset.

- [Accessibility](/skills/accessibility): I specialise in making digital products usable for everyone. That includes coaching teams, fixing code, and shaping accessible design systems
- [User experience design](/skills/user-experience-design): My design work is grounded in research and shaped through collaboration. I focus on interaction design, how things work, and how people move through them
- [Frontend development](/skills/frontend-development): I've been writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for nearly two decades. I work closely with designers and engineers to build clean, accessible, and maintainable frontends
