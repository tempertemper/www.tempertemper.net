title: Frontend development
intro: Accessible markup, clean CSS, and just enough JavaScript; frontend development thatâ€™s maintainable, user-focused and performant.

I'm a [front of the frontend developer](/blog/front-of-the-frontend) and I write well-structured, semantic HTML, and ARIA where necessary; the sites I build are [accessible](/skills/accessibility) to all users and straightforward for other developers to maintain.

I began writing HTML in 2002, but CSS was the reason I fell in love with the web a few years later. I'm happy:

- writing CSS from scratch, and usually use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to add some extra structure and efficiency
- working with other people's CSS, or in a more structured way with CSS methodologies like [BEM](https://getbem.com) or by extending frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

While not your typical 'JavaScript Dev', I am comfortable working within a JavaScript framework, static site generator, or manipulating the DOM to add some usability enhancements.
