title: Frontend development
intro: |
    I'm a frontend developer with a strong focus on accessible HTML and CSS and some JavaScript enhancements to improve usability.

I write well-structured, semantic HTML so that the sites I build are [accessible](/skills/accessibility) to all users and straightforward for other developers to maintain.

I began writing HTML in 2002, but CSS was the reason I fell in love with the web a few years later. I'm happy writing CSS from scratch, and usually use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) to add some extra structure and efficiency. I'm also comfortable working with other people's CSS, or in a more structured way with CSS methodologies like [BEM](//getbem.com/) or by extending frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

While not your typical 'JavaScript Dev', I am happy working within a JavaScript framework, static site generator, or manipulating the DOM to add some usability enhancements where necessary.
