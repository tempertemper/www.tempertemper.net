I've been catching up on some reading and came across this nugget in [The "D" in the DOM](https://www.24a11y.com/2018/the-d-in-the-dom/) by Anthony Jeffery for 24A11y:

> To fix it we took the h3 and h4 off of the product names that were being displayed, and placed a visually hidden heading containing the product name before the price of the original and recommended products. This duplication of content was far from ideal, but it was necessary to fix the issue. In hindsight, we should have pressed for a design with a more logical reading order, which would have avoided a suboptimal hack

I'm of the opinion that designers should be able to code. Or, at the minimum, designs should be shown to a frontend developer for critique on implementation (and revision) before they're shown to any stakeholders.
