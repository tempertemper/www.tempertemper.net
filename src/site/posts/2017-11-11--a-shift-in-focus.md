title: A shift in focus

    "Change is the only constant", said a Greek fella a few thousand years ago. Turns out this is very true. And it happens when you least need/expect it!

It has been a while since I've written a blog article. In fact the last significant content update my website had was back in September 2016, in the [Resources section](/resources).

Since then, a lot has changed.

Around the time that last article went up, I bumped into a friend-and-long-time-client who had recently moved jobs. During our conversation, we got talking about a user experience design position that they were looking to fill and how I'd be perfect for the job.

But I was very happy doing what I had been doing for the previous seven years!

Another chance meeting and a few persuasive chats over coffee and I was sold. It was a massive decision for me and my family and---I'll be honest---I'm still adjusting to employment. But it was the right decision.


## Why no blogging?

My blog used to be focussed on my clients -- tips, tricks and resources to explain foreign (and often technical) concepts to them in layperson's terms. It also served as a good point of entry for potential clients who were searching for solutions to problems I might have answered on my blog. Marketing, of a kind!

So I was now an employee, and while I still continued to work with a clutch of my favourite clients, I wasn't taking any new work on. So the resources-style blog wasn't something that needed much attention.

Any energy I put into my site was spent converting the then-blog into a stand-alone Resources section, freeing up the blog for more traditional blogging. This was no small task!


## A shift of focus

So you'll notice a huge shift in focus on this website. It's no centred on freelance and on-person-agency work; instead it's all about me as a designer and frontend developer. I'll be writing about my opinions, things I've been up to, design and development challenges I've overcome, that kind of thing.

The [Resources section](/resources) will always be there for my clients and small website owners, and I don't plan to abandon it!

It's just that other designers' and developers' writing has been _instrumental_ in my getting to where I am in my career on the web, so hopefully this blog can be of some use to them in return.
