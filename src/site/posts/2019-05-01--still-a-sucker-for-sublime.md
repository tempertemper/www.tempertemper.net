title: Still a sucker for Sublime
intro: |
    Over the years I jumped from one code editor to another before settling on Sublime Text. I've since tried others but keep ending up back with Sublime.

My coding days started on a hooky copy of Dreamweaver, back when it was still a Macromedia product. A few years later when I decided I was going to be a professional web designer/developer, I forked out for a copy of Adobe Creative Suite (CS) 3 Web Premium.

CS4 and CS5 quickly followed and the upgrade costs were prohibitive for my bootstrapped little business, so I made do with Dreamweaver CS3 until early 2011 when [Panic's Coda](https://panic.com/coda/) caught my eye.

As well as being a significantly cheaper commitment than Dreamweaver and the Creative Suite, Coda was much more light-weight than Dreamweaver, as well as being nicer to use. Coda wasn't without its quirks though, so a year or so later Coda 2 was released it was a no-brainer purchase/upgrade. The new version was great but had some weirdness (the sidebar was on the right of the screen…) and felt like a bit of bloat was creeping in.

Not long afterwards I attended a co-working event where someone was using a slick-looking, lightening-fast editor called Sublime Text. I delayed using it for a wee while as there was a bit of a learning curve involved in the set-up/configuration, but when found some time I was hooked!

Over the years I've tried some other editors -- I spent a few months using [Atom](https://atom.io) when it was fairly new; ditto for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). I even [revisited VS Code](https://twitter.com/tempertemper/status/1082565116045000704) recently. But Atom was slow and VS Code had (has) something about it that doesn't feel quite *Mac* enough. I've always ended up coming back to Sublime Text (now on version 3).

Admittedly, there was a lot I enjoyed about the other editors I tried, but luckily Sublime had some options or plugins that enabled these features when I switched back.

I think if JavaScript was a bigger part of my working day, it might be that VS Code could present some compelling reasons to switch, but for now I'm happy.

I don't think it really matters what text editor you use. If it works for you, you should use it. But it might be that another editor has a really compelling feature that'll save you time and/or effort, so keeping an open mind and even spending some time reading up on, downloading and having a poke around in a new app might well be a great idea. Even if, like me, you always seem to end up back where you started!
