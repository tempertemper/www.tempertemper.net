title: They're my rules to break

My new year's resolution was to write more. I've certainly been doing that, and I have begun to establish a nice routine of waking up a couple of hours before the kids in order to get some writing time in each day.

My [first article of the year](/blog/a-new-years-resolution-for-2019) outlined my rules for publishing but, even at this early stage it's clear I have to make an amendment!

One post every week was ambitious.

While I'm not one to say something publicly, only to go back on it, I learned through bitter experience last year that over-committing isn't healthy.

I've found that I prefer slightly longer-form articles---around 1500 words---to short, snappy posts (although this one is shaping up to be just that!). That may change as the year progresses, but for now I'm going to cut myself a bit of slack and aim for fortnightly posts with, perhaps, the odd shorter post in between.
