> “Developing a website to reflect our uniqueness as a school initially seemed a daunting prospect. Martin took the time to understand our needs, never became frustrated with my ineptness with trying to understand CMS systems and made the whole process a breeze. A professional collaboration throughout led to a fantastic website where pictures influence attitudes and the words direct opinion. I would have no hesitation in recommending Martin to colleagues; he delivered on time and on budget. And the children love it too!”
