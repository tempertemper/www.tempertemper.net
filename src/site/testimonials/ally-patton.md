> “I contacted Martin through his website and he responded straight away. We talked on the phone where he asked me a series of questions about my business and how I envisioned the site to be and I knew by the end of the conversation that I was on to a good thing! He's a pleasure to work with and the website is even better than I expected; I aim to be using his service again when the time comes. Thank you Martin for all your hard work.”
