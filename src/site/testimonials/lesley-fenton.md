> “I commissioned Martin to set up a CMS on an existing website I had designed. He tackled the job quickly and competently and was extremely helpful and patient, and always responded immediately to my frequent queries. As a website designer myself, but with limited technical skills, it was very useful to work with someone who understood an issue from a designer's point of view and didn't just try to overwhelm me with tech-speak! I certainly would like to involve Martin again with other projects.”
