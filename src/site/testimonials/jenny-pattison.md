> “I contacted Martin to update an existing website for one of my clients. Despite the time difference between the US and UK, he answered all questions and issues quickly. Martin went above and beyond my expectations. He recommended adjustments to the backend setup to make editing the website easier, which also fixed spacing problems that occurred from the original coder. It was great working with Martin and I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for web development.”
