I support organisations of all sizes, from early-stage startups to global companies, with practical, strategic guidance on building accessibility into their work.

## What I offer

I tailor my support to each team's needs. That might include:

- Strategy and programme design
- Design system integration
- Accessibility audits
- Workshops and capability-building
- Advisory and coaching

### Strategy and programme design

Helping you embed accessibility at scale, from internal governance to team workflows and culture change. I've done this at a FTSE 100 company, with nearly 11,000 employees over 23 countries.

### Design system integration

Making sure accessibility is baked into your components, patterns, and guidance.

### Audits and advice

Manual reviews of websites, apps, and design systems. Rather than providing actionable recommendations I coach teams to find the right solution for them, taking technical/architectural constraints, business requirements, and users into consideration.

### Workshops and capability-building

Training for designers, developers, researchers, QA testers, and product managers on process and techniques for prevention and remediation.


## How I work

I'm remote-first and flexible, but I'm happy to travel occasionally if there's value in being in the room with others. I work closely with teams, not just delivering a report, but helping them understand and act on it. My goal is to build confidence and capability, not dependency.


## Who I work with

I typically partner with:

- Product organisations looking to improve or scale their accessibility practices
- Startups or new products within a wider ecosystem who want to get accessibility right from the start
- Organisations facing regulatory requirements or internal accessibility goals
- Design system and platform teams
