- It meets the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) to level AA
- A good number of AAA success criteria have also been met

I'm not going to go into the work I've done on things like keyboard focus indicators, colour contrast, respecting user preferences, and so on; there's too much to list, and one feature is not necessarily more important than another.

I regularly use my website with the keyboard only, various screen readers, and speech recognition software. I also run automated tests with every change I make to the codebase using [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/).

While I'm not aware of any current issues with this website, there's a chance that something has been missed or broken:

- There's a *lot* of content
- I continually tweak and iterate the design and code

If you have any trouble accessing any part of this website please [raise a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/tempertemper/tempertemper.net/issues) or [get in touch directly](/contact) and I'll fix it as a matter of priority.
