Your brand appears on every blog post, read by many thousands of people, as well as in my monthly email to over 1,000 engaged subscribers.


## What you get

Sponsorship is exclusive; only one sponsor per month. Your message and brand will appear:

- At the top of every blog page
- In a dedicated section of the monthly newsletter
- On every post downloaded from the RSS and JSON feeds

A 'month' is counted as a calendar month, from the first day to the last.

- Blog sponsorship appears on every article and the [index page](/blog/) for the duration of the month
- Newsletter sponsorship is baked into each newsletter, meaning you're guaranteed to arrive into readers' inboxes, and will live on in your sponsored newsletter [in the archives](/newsletter/archive) forever
- Feed sponsorship appears on every post that is downloaded to people's RSS and JSON feed readers during your month of sponsorship
- [Resource articles](/resources/) return in plenty of search results, and your sponsorship appears on each of those pages for your month too

Your sponsor banner includes:
- Your logo
- A link to your website
- A short message

<summary>How your message looks</summary>

Your brand name, logo, and message are presented in a banner at the top of <b>each blog post</b>. The banner is mobile responsive, of course, so it's presented smartly on all screen sizes:

    <source srcset="/assets/img/sponsors/preview--blog-post.avif" type="image/avif" />
    <source srcset="/assets/img/sponsors/preview--blog-post.webp" type="image/webp" />
    <img src="/assets/img/sponsors/preview--blog-post.png" alt="asdf." width="1024" height="576" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
</picture>

The same banner also appears at the top of the <b>blog listing page</b>, shown here in Dark Mode:

    <source srcset="/assets/img/sponsors/preview--blog-list.avif" type="image/avif" />
    <source srcset="/assets/img/sponsors/preview--blog-list.webp" type="image/webp" />
    <img src="/assets/img/sponsors/preview--blog-list.png" alt="asdf." width="1024" height="576" loading="lazy" decoding="async" />
</picture>

<b>RSS and JSON feed subscribers</b> get the same 'Sponsored by…' message at the bottom of each post.

<b>Newsletter subscribers</b> finish their read with a 'Brought to you by…' message:

    <source srcset="/assets/img/sponsors/preview--email.avif" type="image/avif" />
    <source srcset="/assets/img/sponsors/preview--email.webp" type="image/webp" />
