I'm a seasoned digital product designer and frontend developer with a strong track record of embedding accessibility and user-centred design practices in large organisations, public sector teams, and startups.

I've led high-impact initiatives across global teams, delivered WCAG-compliant services, and contributed patterns to major design systems. I'm an experienced leader and an engaging communicator, and regularly give talks and run workshops, both internally and across the wider tech community.
