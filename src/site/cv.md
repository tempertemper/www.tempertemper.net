I'm an interaction designer, frontend developer and co-organiser of Frontend NE, a community meet-up and conference. My focus is well thought-out, inclusive, user-centred designs, and translating them to carefully crafted, accessible HTML and clean, scalable, understandable CSS.

I work in an agile (Scrum) environment on a multi-disciplinary team to deliver research-based designs and product iterations to stakeholders; often having to explain complex decisions in an understandable manner, and balancing user needs with those of the business.

My career has been entirely self driven, soaking up knowledge from online and college courses, books, blog posts, podcasts, friends and peers in the industry, meet-ups, and conferences. This has informed my common-sense and conversational approach to design.


## HMRC (via Orange Bus) – Interaction Designer
<i>March 2018 to present</i>

As part of a Scrum team in the Government's Digital Delivery Centre, I am responsible for designing and iterating on user journeys, page layouts, and individual user interface elements. I work closely with the whole team to produce designs as mockups, flow diagrams and working prototypes (in HTML/CSS/JavaScript) which we put in front of users of the service in order to inform, validate and refine my designs.


## Evaluagent – UI Engineer
<i>February 2017 to March 2018</i>

A suite of [web apps for contact centres](https://www.evaluagent.com); I was responsible for designing and building the user interface for a ground-up redesign/rebuild. I redefined the look and feel of the product, introduced a robust design system, and delivered components (in HTML and CSS) to the dev team as part of a pattern-library-first approach.


## Frontend NE – Director
<i>2015 to present</i>

I'm a founder of [Frontend NE](https://www.frontendne.co.uk), a monthly meet-up started to create a community around frontend development in the North East. We held our our first [conference in 2018](https://2018.frontendne.co.uk) and [our second earlier this year](https://2019.frontendne.co.uk).


## tempertemper – Owner
<i>February 2011 to present</i>

From 2011-17 I worked full time in my own business, working with various small enterprises (between 1 and 20 employees) to produce and maintain their custom built marketing/brochure websites. I also freelanced with various companies where I provided extra or specialist frontend, accessibility and/or UX resource.
