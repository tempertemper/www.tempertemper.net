# 🤓 September's roundup

Hi there!

September has drawn to a close and my part of the UK is back in lockdown 🔒, which means I've had a wee bit more time for writing this month!

I've been thinking a lot about links lately and wrote about why [underlining links is a good idea](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/why-you-should-almost-always-underline-your-links), how [it's easy to style them properly with CSS](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/styling-underlines-with-css), and [the pros and cons of opening links in a new tab/window](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/opening-links-in-a-new-tab-or-window-is-better-avoided) (spoiler alert: it's almost entirely cons!). Here's your full rundown:

1. [Why you should (almost) always underline your links](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/why-you-should-almost-always-underline-your-links)
2. [Styling underlines with CSS](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/styling-underlines-with-css)
3. [Include a date on your blog posts](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/include-a-date-on-your-blog-posts)
4. [Staging different parts of the same file with Git](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/staging-different-parts-of-the-same-file-with-git)
5. [Splitting a hunk in Git’s patch mode](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/splitting-a-hunk-in-gits-patch-mode)
6. [3D touch is gone on Apple Watch ](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/3d-touch-is-gone-on-apple-watch) 
7. [First impressions of iOS 14](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/first-impressions-of-ios-14)
8. [Opening links in a new tab or window is better avoided](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/opening-links-in-a-new-tab-or-window-is-better-avoided)


## Elsewhere on the web

- [The Top 10 Web Design Mistakes of 1999](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/the-top-ten-web-design-mistakes-of-1999/) – amazing that all ten of these still hold true, over 21 years later
- [The Android back button and why we cling to redundant features](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/android-back-button-redundant-design) from a couple of years ago, but an interesting take I stumbled upon when researching my article on [links opening in a new tab/window](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/opening-links-in-a-new-tab-or-window-is-better-avoided)
- [VoiceOver on iOS 14 Supports Description Lists](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/09/voiceover-on-ios-14-supports-description-lists.html) by Adrian Roselli
- An interesting Twitter thread [questioning colour contrast ratio recommendations](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1304490267769221121?s=21)

See you again at the end of October!
