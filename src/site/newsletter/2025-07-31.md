title: üíª Kitting out
---

Heading back into the world of full time self employment again is exciting. It also costs a few quid! I've bought myself a new MacBook and have been getting everything set up just the way I like it. I've also been writing:

1. [Everything has its time](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/everything-has-its-time)
2. [Hierarchy in tables](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/hierarchy-in-tables)
3. [Making sense of accessibility and the law](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/making-sense-of-accessibility-and-the-law)


## More new content!

As well as writing for my blog, I've also refined my [accessibility consultancy page](https://www.tempertemper.net/approaches/consultancy) and written two case studies:

- [Creating a culture of accessibility](https://www.tempertemper.net/portfolio/creating-a-culture-of-accessibility)
- [Scaling accessibility awareness at Sage: five years of GAAD](https://www.tempertemper.net/portfolio/scaling-accessibility-awareness-at-sage-five-years-of-gaad)

Do shout if you're looking for someone to get your company excited about accessibility and make practical changes for the better; [drop me an email](mailto:hello@tempertemper.net) or [say hi on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tempertemper/)!


## From the archives

With a new laptop comes all the technical installation: SSH and GPG keys, Homebrew, Node.js; that kind of thing. I like to take something complicated and make it simple, and I followed my article on [using nvm on macOS](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/using-nvm-on-macos) to get my Node setup working nicely.


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during July:

- [The ‚ÄòAccessibility‚Äô link is a Lie: My Adventures in Weaponizing Corporate Virtue Signaling](https://sightlessscribbles.com/posts/20250724/)
- [On inclusive personas and inclusive user research](https://ericwbailey.website/published/on-inclusive-personas-and-inclusive-user-research/)
- [Accessibility Myth #1: People read on the web](https://uxmyths.com/post/647473628/myth-people-read-on-the-web)
- [aria-label Does Not Translate](https://adrianroselli.com/2019/11/aria-label-does-not-translate.html)
- [7 Everyday Hacks You Wouldn‚Äôt Have Without Disabled People!](https://youtube.com/shorts/_3fjqnl9WwU?si=bZnQ0O9G17FtUfUQ)

Anyway, I‚Äôm off to check I've got everything installed on this laptop before I hand the old one in at work! See you again in at the end of the month üë®‚Äçüíª
