title: 📃 A New Year’s Eve tradition
---

At the end of every year, my wife and I each draw a picture of ourselves, surrounded by all the things we want to achieve in the year ahead. It’s a nice exercise, and a nice thing to look back on, but before I do that I have some stuff for you! First, two blog posts:

1. [Should pagination take you to a new page?](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/should-pagination-take-you-to-a-new-page)
2. [The final nail in the HTML5 document outline coffin](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/the-final-nail-in-the-html5-document-outline-coffin)


## From the archives

Next, something from the archives. In the summer, I wrote about some of the laws that govern accessibility. It was a tricky one to get right, in terms of balancing ease-of-reading with all the references to gnarly legislation, but I hope I got it right: [Making sense of accessibility and the law](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/making-sense-of-accessibility-and-the-law).


## Elsewhere on the web

And finally, here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during December:

- [Meeting WCAG is an achievement](https://yatil.net/blog/meeting-wcag-is-an-achievement)
- [2026 Predictions: The Next Big Shifts in Web Accessibility](https://webaim.org/blog/2026-predictions/)
- [Early signs of EAA enforcement across Europe](https://www.deque.com/blog/early-signs-of-eaa-enforcement-across-europe/)
- [You can’t opt-out of accessibility](https://vale.rocks/posts/accessibility-importance)
- [HTMHell Advent Calendar 2025](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/) (24 posts in one!)

Anyway, I’m off to get my pencils out to do some drawing! See you next year (at the end of January 😉) ✏️
