title: 👻 It’s Halloween!
---

Halloween has arrived and my kids are getting their costumes ready for this evening. My wife has decided to dress up this year too, and they’re all trying to persuade me… As well as all the Halloween prep, I’ve got three blog posts for you this month:

1. [Page headings don’t belong in the header](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/page-headings-dont-belong-in-the-header)
2. [Headers, headings, and titles](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/headers-headings-and-titles)
3. [A big thank you for an incredible leaving present](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/a-big-thank-you-for-an-incredible-leaving-present)


## From the archives

I think about this a lot: if you tried to ship a product that didn’t work with the mouse you’d be told to fix it immediately, even if it worked perfectly well with the keyboard, screen readers, and other assistive technology.

The opposite of that happens *all the time*: our interfaces work well for mouse users, but few other people. A we either don’t notice or, much worse, we notice but decide to ship anyway. Here’s a thing I wrote about that a couple of years ago: [If you’re going to do a job, do it properly](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/if-youre-going-to-do-a-job-do-it-properly).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during October:

- [iOS 26.1 beta 4 adds new setting to tone down Liquid Glass transparency](https://9to5mac.com/2025/10/20/ios-26-1-beta-4-adds-new-setting-to-tone-down-liquid-glass-transparency/)
- [The Web Is About to Get Better for Everyone, Everywhere](https://denodell.com/blog/a-better-web-for-everyone-everywhere)
- [The Majority AI View](https://www.anildash.com/2025/10/17/the-majority-ai-view/)
- [Queens library agrees to major accessibility upgrades after disability rights lawsuit](https://gothamist.com/news/queens-library-agrees-to-major-accessibility-upgrades-after-disability-rights-lawsuit)
- [Designing for Dyslexia: Accessibility Requirements and Best Practices](https://buttondown.com/access-ability/archive/designing-for-dyslexia-accessibility-requirements/)

Anyway, I’m off to have a think about what last-minute Halloween costume I can get away with! See you at the end of next month 🧛‍♂️
