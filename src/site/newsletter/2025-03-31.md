title: üèÜ A long time coming
---

I was born in Glasgow, where my mum is from, and my dad is a Geordie from the North East of England. His side of the family are Newcastle United daft, and it rubbed off on me. So it was a pretty special moment when, two weeks ago, my team won their first trophy in my lifetime. I haven't just been watching the football though; I've written two articles:

1. [How button groups should work for keyboard users](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/how-button-groups-should-work-for-keyboard-users)
2. [How navigation should work for keyboard users](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/how-navigation-should-work-for-keyboard-users)


## From the archives

The rise in popularity of Bluesky ([I have an as-yet unused account](https://bsky.app/profile/tempertemper.bsky.social)) has been interesting, and I was quite excited at Tapbots' announcement of [Phoenix, their Bluesky client](https://tapbots.com/phoenix/).

I'm not sure how Bluesky slots in with [Mastodon, which I'm semi-active on](https://mastodon.social/@tempertemper), yet. Some people are posting the same content to both, but that doesn't feel right. Once I work it out I'll write something, but in the meantime here's a post from the archives on [Mastodon and me](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/mastodon-and-me).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during March:

- [Can I Use for accessibility](https://gomakethings.com/can-i-use-for-accessibility/)
- [Understanding the European Accessibility Act (EAA)](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2025/03/19/understanding-the-eaa/)
- [Making digital spaces more inclusive for people with ADHD, Autism, and Dyslexia](https://intopia.digital/articles/making-digital-spaces-more-inclusive/)
- [Popping preconceived popover ponderings](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2025/03/14/popovers.html)
- [Apple‚Äôs Worldwide Developers Conference returns the week of June 9](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apples-worldwide-developers-conference-returns-the-week-of-june-9/)

Anyway, I'm off to watch the [open top bus parade](https://www.youtube.com/live/5nosaqVkqy4) again.  See you again at the end of April ‚öΩÔ∏è
