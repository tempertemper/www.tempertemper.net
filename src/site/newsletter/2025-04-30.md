title: üßπ Spring cleaning
---

Spring finally is here, and what better excuse to do some deep cleaning and have a bit of a clear-out. Now that the local charity shop is slightly better stocked and my house is clean and tidy, I thought I‚Äôd write you an article about [Focus priming](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/focus-priming). Enjoy!


## From the archives

I noticed [Vitaly Friedman mentioned me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vitalyfriedman_ux-webaccessibility-activity-7319258869656915969-ff_Y) the other day, where he shared a tool by AAArdvark which was inspired by my 2022 blog post [WCAG, but in language I can understand](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wcag-but-in-language-i-can-understand).

By the way, check out AAArdvark‚Äôs [credits/acknowledgments page](https://aaardvarkaccessibility.com/wcag-in-plain-english-credits-and-acknowledgments/) as there are loads of good resources on there.


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during April:

- [FTC Approves Final Order Requiring accessiBe to pay $1 Million](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/04/ftc-approves-final-order-requiring-accessibe-pay-1-million); hopefully more fines to come for accessibility overlay companies
- [What Disabled People Have to Give Up in the Name of Accessibility](https://accessaces.com/what-disabled-people-have-to-give-up-in-the-name-of-accessibility/)
- [A Tool‚Äôs Errand](https://html5accessibility.com/stuff/2025/03/24/a-tools-errand/), outlining the bits of WCAG that need a human to test properly; not just an automated tool
- [Default styles for h1 elements are changing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/h1-element-styles/); the final nail in the coffin of the failed h1s-all-the-way-down document outlining algorithm
- [The 2025 WebAIM Million](https://webaim.org/projects/million/); reviewing the accessibility of the top 1,000,000 homepages

Anyway, I'm off to sit in my sparkling clean living room with a cup of tea. See you again at the end of the May üõãÔ∏è
