title: üéôÔ∏è In the spotlight
---

This month I had a [chat with Chris Nasrawi](https://www.adlib-recruitment.co.uk/design-for-all-feat-martin-underhill) for his Design for All interview series. It was an interesting chat, and I can feel a blog post brewing around a theme that emerged around how important it is to engage with everybody:

> If we want an inclusive culture in the broadest sense, that means including people we disagree with, even those who might initially be dismissive or ableist.

I've also got my first LinkedIn Live broadcast scheduled for tomorrow (01/10/25) at 1pm UK time, so join me then for [An introduction to accessibility](https://www.linkedin.com/events/anintroductiontoaccessibility7374439509406404608/theater/).

Aside from that, one blog post for you this month: [A new MacBook for a new chapter](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/a-new-macbook-for-a-new-chapter).


## From the archives

I added a new page to the Services on my website: [Coaching and mentoring](https://www.tempertemper.net/services/coaching), which deserved a bit of a spotlight of its own. Here are the rest of the services pages:

- [Training and workshops](https://www.tempertemper.net/services/training)
- [Strategy and guidance](https://www.tempertemper.net/services/strategy)
- [Audits and reviews](https://www.tempertemper.net/services/audits)
- [Talks and presentations](https://www.tempertemper.net/services/talks)
- [Culture and community](https://www.tempertemper.net/services/culture)

If you‚Äôre looking for someone to get your company excited about accessibility and make practical changes for the better, [drop me an email](mailto:hello@tempertemper.net) or [say hello on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tempertemper/).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during September:

- Catch up on [Inclusive Design 24 2025](https://inclusivedesign24.org/2025/schedule/)
- [Taking a shot at the double focus ring problem using modern CSS](https://piccalil.li/blog/taking-a-shot-at-the-double-focus-ring-problem-using-modern-css/)
- [Why Moving Away from SPAs (Single Page Apps) improves Usability, Accessibility, and SEO](https://www.innoweb.com.au/blog/why-moving-away-from-spas-improves-usability-accessibility-and-seo)
- [Why Sticky Navigation Can Undermine Accessibility](https://buttondown.com/access-ability/archive/why-sticky-navigation-can-undermine-accessibility/)
- And one for the grammatical pedants out there: [The 25th Anniversary of the Onion Classic: ‚ÄòWilliam Safire Orders Two Whoppers Junior‚Äô](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/09/29/safire-whoppers-junior-25)

Anyway, I‚Äôm off to put the finishing touches on my LinkedIn Live presentation; see you at the end of November, if not tomorrow! üó£Ô∏è
