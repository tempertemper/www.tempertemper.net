title: üè° New house
---

May has been quite the month! We moved house on the 12th so life has been all about packing, chasing solicitors, moving, unpacking and settling in. I did get some thoughts down about tables versus lists though: [Are you sure that table isn‚Äôt a list?](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/are-you-sure-that-table-isnt-a-list).


## From the archives

A couple of weeks back I was working with a developer who was looking to use the `<details>`/`<summary>` HTML elements for an accordion-style component, rather than using `<div>`s, `<button>`s, and ARIA. Turns out it wasn‚Äôt possible without losing the open/close animation, but if the new `::details-content` pseudo element was better supported across web browser ([currently at 71.17% support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_selectors_details-content)) it would have been a go-er.

Cross-browser compatibility isn‚Äôt as big an issue as it used to be, but cross-*user* compatibility can still be a struggle‚Ä¶ Reminded me that I wrote a short post on that: [Ensure your project works in every browser and for every user](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/ensure-your-project-works-in-every-browser-and-for-every-user).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during May:

- [Awareness](https://adactio.com/journal/21911), a typically thoughtful piece by Jeremy Keith on   Global Accessibility Awareness Day
- [Apple unveils powerful accessibility features coming later this year](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2025/05/apple-unveils-powerful-accessibility-features-coming-later-this-year/) (I‚Äôm particularly pleased with Accessibility Nutrition Labels)
- [Defect Prevention: Reducing Costs and Enhancing Quality](https://www.isixsigma.com/software/defect-prevention-reducing-costs-and-enhancing-quality/); IBM talk about the cost of accessibility defects found after the design phase
- [Defining RACI Roles for Improving Digital Accessibility](https://www.accessarmada.com/blog/defining-raci-roles-for-improving-digital-accessibility/)
- [The curb-cut effect](https://sketchplanations.com/the-curb-cut-effect); an oldie, but a goodie

Anyway, I‚Äôm off to get back up that ladder with the paintbrush. See you again in at the end of June ü™ú
