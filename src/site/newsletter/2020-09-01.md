# 🌦 August's roundup

Hello!

It has been a wet month where I live ☔️ Despite being cooped up indoors, I only managed five posts, rather than the fifteen I managed the month before. I've had a lot going on with a change of jobs, so needed to put my focus elsewhere.

I can't promise fifteen posts this coming month (that kind of pace doesn't feel very sustainable…) but I've got a few posts in the pipeline and have some time off between jobs where I've scheduled to (finally!) record some HTML fundamentals videos. Watch this space 🎥

## From the blog

August marked my last month working in UK government, after 2½ years. I wrote [the briefest of posts](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/saying-goodbye-to-uk-government) to mark the end of an era.

I also got a bit excited about an iOS 14 feature they didn't mention at WWDC called [Back Tap](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/ios-14s-back-tap-a-better-way-to-access-control-centre). I think it could be a great work-around for the awkward Control Centre access gesture on Face ID iPhones. Let's hope iOS 14 lands this month.

Here's the full list of posts from August:

1. [Saying goodbye to UK government](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/saying-goodbye-to-uk-government)
2. [WebKit has fixed the implicit role on footers](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/webkit-has-fixed-the-implicit-role-on-footers)
3. [iOS 14’s Back Tap; a better way to access Control Centre](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/ios-14s-back-tap-a-better-way-to-access-control-centre)
4. [Putting the time in up front](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/putting-the-time-in-up-front)
5. [Text snippets on Apple devices](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/text-snippets-on-apple-devices)


## Elsewhere on the web

Mostly accessibility related this month:

- [5 most annoying website features I face as a blind person every single day](https://bighack.org/5-most-annoying-website-features-i-face-as-a-blind-screen-reader-user-accessibility/)
- [A Guide to Understanding What Makes a Typeface Accessible](https://uxdesign.cc/a-guide-to-understanding-what-makes-a-typeface-accessible-and-how-to-make-informed-decisions-9e5c0b9040a0)
- [The difference between aria-label and aria-labelledby](https://tink.uk/the-difference-between-aria-label-and-aria-labelledby/)

In a slight change in scheduling this month, the next newsletter will be with you on the 30th of September – it makes more sense to send a monthly roundup on the last day of each month! See you then 👋
