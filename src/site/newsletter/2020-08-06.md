# 📝 Is it August already!?

Hi there!

August is here already, and July was a busy month! So much so that I broke my record for the most blog posts in a single month, with 15 😅

## From the blog

I wrote a lot about images, from [aspect ratios](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/using-image-aspect-ratios-to-avoiding-janky-page-loading) and [native lazy loading](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/lazy-loading-images-without-javascript) to the (sort of) new [WebP format](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/using-webp-images).

I also announced that [I'll be back for the final Frontend NE](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/frontend-ne-draws-to-a-close), after a year or so in the background. Who knows when we'll be able to hold that last meet-up, or what it'll look like, but I'll be there!

## Elsewhere on the web

I don't want to overload you, but I always like to include some other articles from around the web, for balance. So here are a couple of good articles for your reading pleasure:

- [Why you should hire a frontend developer](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/07/24/why-you-should-hire-a-frontend-developer/) by Matt Hobbs, Head of Frontend at GDS

See you again on the first Thursday of next month 👋
