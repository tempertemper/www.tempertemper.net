You are awesome! And the other 999 people who subscribe to this newsletter are awesome too. Y’see, in November I passed one thousand subscribers! Thank you.

I pulled myself together enough to write two articles for you this month:

1. [The return of the heading group](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/the-return-of-the-heading-group)
2. [An accessible pagination pattern (or two)](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/an-accessible-pagination-pattern-or-two)


## From the archives

I've been giving some webinars on LinkedIn Live lately, which I'm calling Accessibility Corner. This week I talked about [the trouble with icon-only buttons](https://www.linkedin.com/events/thetroublewithicon-onlybuttons7399034474149081088/theater/), which I took from my blog post from a few years ago: [What I wish was in WCAG: prohibit icon-only buttons](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/what-i-wish-was-in-wcag-prohibit-icon-only-buttons). Still very much worth a read!


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during November:

- [Maybe Don’t Name That Landmark](https://adrianroselli.com/2024/06/maybe-dont-name-that-landmark.html)
- [Just use a button](https://gomakethings.com/just-use-a-button/)
- [5 reasons why WCAG AA compliance does not mean your website is accessible](https://www.craigabbott.co.uk/blog/2025/5-reasons-why-wcag-aa-compliance-does-not-mean-your-website-is-accessible/)
- [Ads and accessibility mismatch](https://axesslab.com/ads-and-accessibility-mismatch/)
- [Electron Apps Causing System-Wide Lag on MacOS 26 Tahoe](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/20/electron-apps-slow-down-tahoe), or: native apps are so much better

Anyway, I’m off to steady my nerves with a cup of tea, knowing how many people will read this! See you at the end of December 🫖
