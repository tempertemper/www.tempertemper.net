title: 🐱🐱 Cats!
---

Busy times at Casa tempertemper! I’ve left employment to move into the world of consultancy (my last day was on the 21st), and we’ve welcomed some feline friends into our new home: 10 month old brothers [Stevie and Milo](https://mastodon.social/@tempertemper/115124787170284297).

As well as spending time with the cats, I’ve also been busy adding content to my website; a blog post on [focusing accessibility efforts on the people that make things happen](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/focus-on-the-people-that-make-things-happen), and a [new Services page](https://www.tempertemper.net/services/).

If you’re looking for someone to get your company excited about accessibility and make practical changes for the better, I have immediate availability! [Drop me an email](mailto:hello@tempertemper.net) or [say hello on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tempertemper/) 👋


## From the archives

One from the very recent archives, ‘[Focus priming](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/focus-priming)’ is a phrase I’ve found myself using again and again while training people to use the keyboard on its own and screen reader software. Trainees seem to get the concept straight away when I use that phrase, where previously I needed to give much more explanation.

Huge thanks again to [James Rutherford](https://mastodon.social/@jtruk/114383257428586767).


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during August:

- [Accessibility and the agentic web](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2025/08/08/accessibility-and-the-agentic-web/)
- [Can components conform to WCAG?](https://hidde.blog/component-conformance/)
- [“Best practice” is just your opinion](https://www.craigabbott.co.uk/blog/best-practice-is-just-your-opinion/)
- [Avoiding the word “help”](https://yatil.net/blog/avoiding-the-word-help)
- [Apple To Debut TechWoven Cases For iPhone 17 Lineup](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/26/majin-bu-techwoven) (I hope these are good! I miss the leather cases, and I had to return the silicone case for my 16 Pro after only 9 months…)

Anyway, I’m off to play with Stevie and Milo. See you again in at the end of September 🧶
