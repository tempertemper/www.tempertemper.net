title: ðŸ”Ž New job
---

Last month I moved house, so just to keep things spicy I decided was it was time for a new job too! As well as looking for work, Iâ€™ve been doing a fair bit of writing:

1. [Colour alone can be used to convey meaning, and I donâ€™t like it!](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/colour-alone-can-be-used-to-convey-meaning-and-i-dont-like-it)
2. [WWDC 2025 roundup](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/wwdc-2025-roundup)
3. [Erring on the side of caution](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/erring-on-the-side-of-caution)


## From the archives

I tend to avoid talking about accessibility in terms of WCAG (the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) conformance. Accessibility is not a checklist; itâ€™s about *people*. Iâ€™ve never met a user experience designer who stops at functional; itâ€™s always about making things smooth, and even delightful, for the user. This should also be the case for disabled users, and WCAG is a good start but can encourage a culture of â€˜just enoughâ€™.

Unsurprisingly, Iâ€™ve written about it how [accessibility doesnâ€™t stop at WCAG compliance](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/accessibility-doesnt-stop-at-wcag-compliance).


## While I've got you

After five years helping a large organisation (11k employees, 23 countries, countless products)transform its accessibility approach, things are in a good place; itâ€™s time for me to move on and [help others do the same](https://www.tempertemper.net/approaches/consultancy).

Iâ€™m particularly good at driving cultural change, improving processes, coaching teams, and delivering training, as well as the more hands-on work of identifying accessibility issues and recommending fixes. Iâ€™ll be available for new contracts from late September.

If your companyâ€™s looking to strengthen its digital accessibility, Iâ€™d love to chat: [drop me an email](mailto:hello@tempertemper.net) or [say hi on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tempertemper/)!


## Elsewhere on the web

Here are some of the more interesting bits and bobs that I came across from around the web during June:

- [Youâ€™re not an accessibility specialist until youâ€™veâ€¦](https://cerovac.com/a11y/2025/06/youre-not-an-accessibility-specialist-until-youve/)
- [Selfish reasons for building accessible UIs](https://nolanlawson.com/2025/06/16/selfish-reasons-for-building-accessible-uis/)
- [Be Careful Using â€˜Menuâ€™](https://adrianroselli.com/2023/05/be-careful-using-menu.html)
- [Pride, shame, and accessibility](https://heydonworks.com/article/pride-shame-and-accessibility/)
- [So, you screwed up your EAA compliance. What now?](https://yatil.net/blog/so-you-screwed-up-your-eaa-compliance-what-now)

Anyway, Iâ€™m off to give that CV some more polish! Exciting times! See you again in at the end of July ðŸš€
