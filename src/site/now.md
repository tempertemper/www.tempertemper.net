intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- About to move house! After 8 years in our current place, we're moving to a semi-detached not 100 metres from where we currently live. The view is incredible view; watch this space!
- Final preparation for Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) at work; two months of graft and still lots to organise!
- Work have upped the days-in-the-office quota to three days, so I'm cycling 16 kilometre (each way) an extra day now. At least the weather's improving!
- Enjoying watching [my football team](https://www.newcastleunited.com) when I can; over the moon with the [recent cup win](https://youtu.be/pann5OfR248), and hoping for a strong finish in the league
- Still playing Pokémon Go (I'm currently level 46), even though my son's interest in playing wavers…
- Five years into the [daily cold showers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
