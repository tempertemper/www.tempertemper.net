- Setting myself up as an [accessibility consultant](/approaches/consultancy), and ready to start a new project now
- Enjoying our new [cat pals](https://mastodon.social/@tempertemper/115124787170284297)
- Settling into our new house; we've been here 4 months now and it now feels like home (and [that viewâ€¦](https://mastodon.social/@tempertemper/115175810602017803))
- Tackling the brambles; our new garden is big and very overgrown, so we've made a start on pulling out the bramble bushes (not before picking the blackberries!)
- Feeling refreshed after a week with my whole family in the Lake District
- Relieved the kids are back at school; summer holidays are long and brutal
- Enjoying that the new football season has begun
