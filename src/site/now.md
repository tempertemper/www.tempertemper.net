title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- On the lookout for a new job, starting September, after handing my notice in at work
- Just moved house! After 8 years in our last place, we're moving to a semi-detached less than 100 metres away; it's further up the hill and the view is incredible!
- Still tying up the loose ends after a successful Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD) at work; three months of graft and two amazing days of accessibility empathy labs and conference talks
- Work have upped the days-in-the-office quota to three days, so I'm cycling 16 kilometre (each way) an extra day now. The boiler is broken so the showers are cold but at least the weather is decent at this time of year!
- Enjoyed watching my football team's [recent cup win](https://youtu.be/pann5OfR248) and qualification for next year's Champion's League
- Five years into the [daily cold showers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v83f)
