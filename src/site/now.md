title: The things I'm up to right now
intro: |
    You've seen my [blog](/blog/) and [about page](/about) so you know what I'm interested in and how I ended up doing what I do, but what am I up to *right now*?

- Happily contracting as an interaction designer in UK government again, after 3 months out post-Sage (I *really* needed that time); it feels good to get back into the nitty gritty of design
- Enjoying our [new feline friends](https://mastodon.social/@tempertemper/115124787170284297), Stevie and Milo
- Loving our new house and [its view…](https://mastodon.social/@tempertemper/115175810602017803); it's a decent size, so we (successfully!) hosted a Hogmanay party of 20-ish people to test it out
- Helping my wife set up [her business as a psychodynamic counsellor](https://www.bearodriguez.com)
- Excited for what 2026 has in store! My two themes are looking like health and broadcasting:
    - I've been running again; only every few days, but it's feeling good to start finding my rhythm
    - A burst of LinkedIn Live broadcasts have inspired me, and I'm looking forward to more, plus I have some plans for [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/tempertemper) too
