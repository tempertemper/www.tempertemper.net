Meta data is website content that isn't displayed on a webpage; data that is hidden away behind the scenes.

It includes things like:

- [Page descriptions](/resources/page-descriptions)
- [Page titles](/resources/page-titles)
- [Social media](/resources/giving-social-media-the-right-information) 'cards' and 'open graph' information
- [Bookmark icons](/resources/bookmark-icons)

It's stuff that's not helpful to your people who are looking at your webpage, but very useful when your website is 'scanned' by search engines, social networks and other non-human visitors.
