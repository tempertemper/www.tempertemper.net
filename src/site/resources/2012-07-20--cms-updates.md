It's important to keep your website up to date and this doesn't just stop at the content that's on there. It's likely your site will incorporate some kind of content management system (CMS) that allows you to edit content.

There are a few reasons that it's a good idea to make sure your CMS is up to date:


## Features

Your CMS is a little software program that runs on your website, behind the scenes. Any software provider worth their salt is always thinking of new ways to improve their product and make their users' experience of their product better.

The latest version of a CMS will give you the best experience possible and will sometimes add useful features that could make your website even better!


## Bug fixes

There are always little glitches to iron out of a piece of software.


## Security

This is the biggie! Your website is in a very public place and is always vulnerable to attack. It's not that the CMS you have installed was never watertight, it's more that hackers constantly look to find new ways to break into your server.

It's a wee bit like the software on your computer -- installing those Windows Updates and keeping your virus software bang up to date (or, if you're a Mac user, making sure your Software Update runs when it needs to) is necessary to keep the bad guys out.


## Prevention is better than cure

It's not a likelihood that your CMS will be hacked, more a possibility, and the consequences can be costly: loss of sales/enquiries while the site is down, paying your web designer to drop everything and sort the issue out as soon as possible, and possibly your reputation may take a hit if your site is taken over and used for advertising.
