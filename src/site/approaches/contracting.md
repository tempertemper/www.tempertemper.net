Alongside my [consultancy work](/approaches/consultancy), I occasionally take on contract and freelance roles; either in the public sector as an [interaction designer](/skills/user-experience-design) or [accessibility specialist](https://www.tempertemper.net/skills/accessibility), or in the private sector as an accessibility specialist.

That might mean embedding within a design, frontend, or multidisciplinary team; taking on an interim position, covering a short-term gap, or picking up work a team doesn't have time for. I'm comfortable joining existing teams and fitting into established ways of working.

I typically work on 6-, 12-, or 18-month contracts, remotely by default, but I'm open to hybrid arrangements if regular on-site time is needed. I can work outside IR35 through my limited company, or inside IR35 via an umbrella company such as [PayStream](https://www.paystream.co.uk).

I've worked with organisations like HMRC and understand the pace, structure, and expectations of government contracts. If you need short-term support in accessibility or interaction design, feel free to [get in touch](/contact).
