order: 1
---

I support organisations of all sizes, from early-stage startups to global companies, with practical, strategic guidance on building accessibility into their work.

My approach is collaborative and approachable, making accessibility feel practical and achievable rather than daunting. Working closely with teams, I help make accessibility part of everyday practice; encouraging learning, collaboration, and continuous improvement rather than just handing over a list of fixes. The goal is to build confidence and capability, not dependency.


## What I offer

I tailor my support to each teamâ€™s needs, drawing on experience from a FTSE 100 company with nearly 11,000 employees across 23 countries. That might include:

- [Audits and reviews](/services/audits) of websites, apps, and design systems, with follow-up support to prioritise fixes and guide delivery teams
- [Training and workshops](/services/training) to build capability across roles, from designers and developers to product managers
- [Strategic guidance](/services/strategy), to embed accessibility into policies, programmes, and everyday practice


## Typical engagement

Every organisation is different, but most consultancy partnerships follow a similar path. We usually begin with discovery and an audit, where I learn how your business operates (the people, teams, culture, and workflows) and assess key products to identify barriers to accessibility.

From there, we move into embedding accessibility across your organisation:

- <b>Awareness and culture</b>, establishing community spaces and regular touch points, and giving presentations to build awareness
- <b>Training and upskilling</b>, with hands-on coaching and workshops tailored to different roles
- <b>Process and policy integration</b>, embedding accessibility into team workflows, and guiding teams to the tools and practices that will help
- <b>Documentation and guidance</b>, creating clear, practical resources in your design system, intranet, or team wikis to help teams work accessibly
- <b>Compliance and metrics</b>, establishing KPIs and tracking progress over time

I'm remote-first, but I'm happy to travel occasionally if there's value in being in the room with others.


## Who I work with

I typically partner with:

- Product organisations looking to improve or scale their accessibility practices
- Startups or new products within a wider ecosystem that want to get accessibility right from the start
- Organisations facing regulatory requirements or internal accessibility goals
- Design system and platform teams
