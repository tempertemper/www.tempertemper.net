Sometimes you need a clearly defined piece of work without a long-term engagement. Examples of typical projects include:

- [Accessibility audits](/services/audits) to assess where your product stands
- [Website design and build](/services/websites), whether making an existing site more accessible or a full new build
- [Training sessions or workshops](/services/training) to build skills and confidence in your teams

These projects are designed to be focused and manageable, with a fixed scope and timescale. They can run from a few days to a couple of months, depending on the job, and give you practical outcomes you can act on right away.

A project might be all you need, or it can be a first step. If you want broader support shaping policy, process, or culture, I also offer [consultancy](/approaches/consultancy). If you need someone embedded in your delivery team for a longer period, take a look at [contracting](/approaches/contracting).
